## fig. 1. STAR Overview (ARC³)

**Situation:** Portfolio case studies are often fluffy, inconsistent, and hard to evaluate. Reviewers need clear evidence, while hiring managers want business impact. ARC³ addresses this gap with opinionated guardrails that tie goals to results.

**Task:** Define and package a repeatable framework that:
- Encodes three lanes — **A**nchor & Aim, **R**esearch & Realization, **C**haracterization & Continuation.
- Forces an **A.4 → C.1** contract (every success criterion defined up front must reappear in the outcome table).
- Supports modes (**Standard / Qual / Lite**) and a dual-lane **Impact/Evidence** summary.
- Sets reliability targets (e.g., κ ≥ 0.70 where applicable) and explicit **GO / PIVOT / PAUSE** gates.

**Action (placeholder):**
- Drafted Markdown/MDX templates and components to render an ARC³ **STAR Summary Card** (one screen) with mode badge.
- Authored **A/R/C** section scaffolds, including:
  - **A.4 Hypotheses & Success Criteria** list with OWNER and DATA SOURCE fields.
  - **C.1 Outcome tables** for Quant (Standard/Lite) and Qual modes.
  - **C.3 Continuation plan** with triggers and kill-criteria.
- Added accessibility notes (target: WCAG 2.2 AA), SI/ISO-8601 conventions, and evidence table placeholders.
- Created icon set and minimal visual system (blueprint grid, industry/academic ribbon).
- (TBD) Starter repo to auto-generate **C.1** from **A.4** and stamp mode badges.

**Result (placeholder):** v1 template drafted; sample “hello ARC³” case stub created. Planned validation:
- **Time-to-case** ≤ 4 hours for a new project (n≈5 pilot users) — *TBD*  
- **SUS** ≥ 80 from test readers — *TBD*  
- **IRR (κ)** ≥ 0.70 on C.1 scoring across two raters — *TBD*  
- **Decision clarity** (reviewers correctly infer GO/PIVOT/PAUSE) ≥ 90% — *TBD*


## Full Case Study

TODO: This is where the full, detailed case study for Project Alpha would go. It would include sections on research, ideation, design process, technical implementation, and outcomes. For now, it is a placeholder.
