## fig. 1. STAR Overview

**Situation:** Creative professionals are often overwhelmed with managing repetitive, non-creative tasks, which hinders their productivity and creative flow.

**Task:** My goal was to design and build a proof-of-concept for an AI assistant that could automate these tasks through a simple, conversational interface, thereby freeing up users to focus on high-value creative work.

**Action:**
- Conducted user interviews with 15 designers and writers to identify key pain points.
- Developed a low-fidelity prototype in Figma to test core user flows.
- Built a full-stack application using Astro for the frontend and a simple Node.js server for the backend AI integration.
- Implemented a conversational UI that felt natural and intuitive.

**Result:** The resulting prototype was able to successfully automate 80% of the identified repetitive tasks. User feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with participants noting a significant reduction in cognitive load and an increase in creative output.

## Full Case Study

TODO: This is where the full, detailed case study for Project Alpha would go. It would include sections on research, ideation, design process, technical implementation, and outcomes. For now, it is a placeholder.
