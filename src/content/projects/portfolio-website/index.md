## fig. 1. STAR Overview

**Situation:** The company's core internal platform was built on outdated technology, making it difficult to maintain, slow to perform, and unpopular with the development team.

**Task:** I was tasked with leading the research and architectural design for a new, modernized version of the platform that would improve performance by 50% and significantly boost developer satisfaction.

**Action:**
- Performed a deep-dive audit of the existing system's architecture and codebase.
- Surveyed the development team to create a "Developer Experience" baseline score.
- Designed a new microservices-based architecture using modern, well-supported technologies.
- Created a detailed migration plan to ensure a phased, low-risk rollout.

**Result:** The new architecture is projected to exceed performance goals. The migration plan was approved by leadership, and initial feedback on the DevEx improvements has been extremely positive, with a 40% increase in the baseline satisfaction score after the first phase.
