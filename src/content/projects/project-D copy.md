## fig. 1. STAR Overview

**Situation:** The organization's standard reporting dashboards were visually appealing but completely inaccessible to users with visual impairments or those relying on keyboard navigation.

**Task:** My objective was to create a new, fully accessible library of data visualization components (charts, graphs, tables) that could replace the existing ones without sacrificing aesthetics.

**Action:**
- Conducted an accessibility audit of the existing components, identifying all WCAG violations.
- Researched best practices for accessible data visualizations, including color contrast, focus management, and ARIA roles.
- Built a new component library from the ground up in React, with accessibility as the primary design constraint.
- Wrote comprehensive documentation for each component, including usage guidelines for maintaining accessibility.

**Result:** The new library passed all WCAG 2.2 AA tests. When deployed, it allowed all users, regardless of ability, to access and understand critical company data. The project has become the new standard for all internal tooling.

## Full Case Study

TODO: This is where the full, detailed case study for Project Gamma would go. It would include sections on research, ideation, design process, technical implementation, and outcomes. For now, it is a placeholder.
