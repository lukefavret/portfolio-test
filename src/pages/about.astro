        <p>TODO: Replace this with your own ~150-250 word bio.</p>
        <p>
          I am a designer and developer driven by a deep-seated curiosity for
          how things work. My approach is rooted in a "first principles" way of
          thinking, breaking down complex problems into their fundamental parts
          to build robust, intuitive, and accessible solutions. I believe the
          best digital experiences are not just functional but also respectful
          of the user's time and attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a background that touches both creative arts and engineering, I
          find myself uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between design and
          development. I'm passionate about creating systems that are not only
          beautiful and easy to use but also performant and maintainable. This
          portfolio is a reflection of that philosophyâ€”built from the ground up
          with a focus on clean architecture, minimal JavaScript, and strict
          adherence to accessibility standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          My downtime is for diving into other worlds. I love the dense,
          imaginative fiction of authors like Ursula K. Le Guin, the challenge
          of capturing an overlooked perspective with my camera, and the offbeat
          artistry of a great indie game.
