        TODO: This is a placeholder privacy policy. You should replace this
        with your own policy, detailing any data you collect, such as through
        analytics (e.g., Vercel Analytics, Plausible) or contact forms.

        Currently, this website is static and does not use cookies, tracking

      <p>
        As no information is collected, none is used. Should this change in the
